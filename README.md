# Berlin_stats_and_airbnb
Work on 2 Kaggle datasets about Berlin (Airbnb data and crime data) that shall be enriched with several local data sources.

This work is for a decision maker of our choice, in my case someone from Airbnb responsible for the Berlin market, who aims to find out how the offer is faring, how the market environment is developing and more.

The goal is to prepare the data first, then provide meaningful predictions and visualisations that will be done in a Tableau workbook.

**Structure**

- data: data files that are below the 25MB threshold
- utils: some functions to convert the .ipynb workbook into regular Python files later
- visualisations: the Tableau workbook file(s)
